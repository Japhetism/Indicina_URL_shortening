# 🔗 ShortLink – URL Shortener

ShortLink is a simple and efficient URL shortening service. Enter a long URL (e.g., `https://indicina.co`) and get a short version like `http://short.est/GeAi9K`. When visited, the short link redirects to the original URL.

This repository contains both the **backend (API)** and the **frontend (UI)** of the application.
